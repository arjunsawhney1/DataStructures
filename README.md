# Introduction
In this repo, I build and unit test several classic and custom Data Structures from scratch. 

## Classic Data Structures
- Doubly Linked List
- Hash Table
- Binary Search Tree
- d-Heap

## Custom Data Structures
- DAFTree: Modified generic Binary Search Tree that supports storing duplicates
- FADAF (Fast Access DAF): allows fast add, remove, lookup using a DAFTree and HashTable

## Implementations
- DLLQueue
- DLLStack
- DLL Round Robin Scheduler
- BloomFilter
- Huffman Compression Tree
- Priority Queue
